### Notes
* The textarea used to modify the docker-compose.yml file has been customized to allow you to add/remove indent to your lines. However, this broke the browser-specific undo/redo functions when used from the menu (either in edit or on right-click). Please use the keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z) to undo / redo your modifications.
